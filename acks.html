            <p><em>Every bit as vile as paladins are heroic, the anti-paladin is the dark twin of those champions of light. Fanatical followers of the chthonic gods, anti-paladins are capable of any atrocity, any villainy, in service of their divine patrons, furthering the spread of chaos, evil and corruption. Anti-paladins are unconstrained by codes of conduct, their only true inviolate tenets being unwavering faith in their unholy patron, and the drive to spread the patron’s particular brand of evil by whatever means necessary. Cunning, treachery, and deception are all considered worthy tools in the anti-paladin’s arsenal, weapons every bit as valuable as the most savage blade.</em></p>

            <h5>Full Description</h5>
            <p>As unholy warriors, anti-paladins are vicious combatants. At first level, anti-paladins hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Like fighters, they advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. Anti-paladins increase their base damage roll from missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level.</p>
            <p>They may wear any armor, and may fight with a broad array of weapons, including the battle axe, dagger, flail, mace, morning star, pole arm, short sword, spear, sword, two-handed sword, and whip. All anti-paladins may fight wielding a weapon and shield, wielding a weapon two-handed, or wielding a weapon in each hand, as desired. They may use any magic item usable by fighters.</p>
            <p>All anti-paladins must be of Chaotic alignment. An anti-paladin who changes to Neutral or Lawful alignment loses his class powers and will suffer greatly for such betrayal. If he later reverts to Chaotic alignment and atones for any misdeeds (possibly through a dire quest or atonement spell) he can regain his lost powers. (An anti-paladin who became Lawful could be permitted to become a paladin at the Judge’s discretion. Woe to such a turncoat though, for he will be hunted).</p>
            <p>In exchange for their devotion to Chaos, antipaladins receive many powers to aid them in their crusades against Law and peace. Foremost among these is their aura of protection, which gives them a +1 bonus to AC and a +1 bonus on saving throws against attacks made or effects created by good creatures. The anti-paladin’s aura of protection appears as a writhing tenebrous shroud when viewed with detect evil, detect magic, or true seeing.</p>
            <p>Anti-Paladins are intimately familiar with the dire energies of necromancy and possess the ability to command undead as per a Chaotic cleric of half their level (round up). This provides them with the potential to surround themselves with terrifying, fearless, and utterly loyal minions.</p>
            <p>In order to defeat the enemies of Chaos, the anti-paladin must find them. To this end, an anti-paladin can detect good (as the reversed form of the detect evil spell) up to 60' away simply by concentrating. Each use takes a turn. (For purposes of the antipaladin’s aura and detection abilities, “good” creatures include any creatures of Lawful alignment, and Neutral creatures with good intentions. Pinnacles of good and magic items harmful to those of Chaotic alignment will also be detected by the antipaladin’s power.)</p>
            <p>Finally, anti-paladins are awash with the same powers of unlife they can command. Should they become intelligent undead, whether as a reward from their chthonic patron or through efforts of their own, they can continue to advance in the antipaladin class, as per the Zaharan’s after the flesh power. Such undead antipaladins are called Death Knights.</p>
            <p>When an anti-paladin reaches 5th level (Blackguard), his unholy fanaticism inspires others to follow him. Any hirelings of the same religion as the anti-paladin gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he is present. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the anti-paladin’s Charisma or proficiencies.</p>
            <p>At 9th level (Malefactor Lord), an anti-paladin can found or capture a dark fortress and become a scourge on the surrounding lands. When he does so, up to 1d4+1x10 0th level mercenaries and 1d6 anti-paladins of 1st-3rd level will come to apply for jobs and training. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries. Anti-paladins’ dark fortresses are otherwise identical to fighters’ castles, as detailed in the Campaign chapter of the ACKS Rulebook.</p>

            <h5>Full Description</h5>
            <p>Assassins are expert combatants, though lacking somewhat in toughness (hit points). At first level, assassins hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws as fighters, by two points every three levels of experience. Assassins increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level.</p>
            <p>Assassins may use any weapon without limitation. Although assassins generally prefer fast, concealable, or quiet weapons, killing can occur under many circumstances. They may fight using a weapon two-handed, a weapon in each hand, or a weapon and shield.</p>
            <p>Assassins may wear any type of armor, but most favor stealth over steel. When wearing leather armor or lighter garb, an assassin may move silently, hide in shadows, and backstab as a thief of the same level. If wearing armor heavier than leather, these abilities are not available:
                <ul>
                <li>Moving Silently: Assassins may move with total silence. When successful, even keen eared guards will not hear the movements of an assassin. However, the assassin always thinks he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise unless and until others react to his presence. Assassins may move silently at ½ their standard combat movement rate without penalty. If they move greater than ½ speed, they take a -5 penalty to the proficiency throw. If they run, they take a -10 penalty.</li>
                <li>Hiding in Shadows: An assassin may attempt to skulk unseen in the cover of darkness. An assassin will always think he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise until others react to his presence. An assassin will remain hidden so long as he stays motionless. If he moves, he must make a new proficiency throw to hide.</li>
                <li>An assassin also has the ability to backstab. He must catch an opponent unaware of his presence, either by surprise or by moving silently and/or hiding in shadows to sneak up on his opponent. When backstabbing, the assassin will receive an attack bonus of +4 and, if successful, deal additional damage for every four levels he has attained.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Upon reaching 9th level (Assassin), an assassin may construct a hideout. When an assassin builds a hideout, he will gain 2d6 1st level assassin apprentices, come to learn under a master. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for ruffians. These thugs will serve the character with some loyalty, though at least one will be an infiltrator working for the assassin’s local rivals, sent to keep an eye on the character.</p>

            <h5>Full Description</h5>
            <p>Whatever their background, barbarians are fierce and deadly combatants. At first level, barbarians hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience (i.e. the same progression as fighters).</p>
            <p>Barbarians increase their base damage roll from their choice of either missile or melee attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. The barbarian must choose which type of attack will receive the damage bonus at 1st level, and may not change the choice as he advances (i.e. they may choose to be either melee or missile specialists).</p>
            <p>Because barbarians lack the broad professional training of the fighter, they may only wear chain mail or lighter armor, and are limited to fighting with the traditional weapons and styles of their tribe. When a barbarian is created, select a region of origin for the character, and note down the permitted weapons and fighting styles. The Judge may create other regions of origin for barbarians within his own campaign setting where necessary.</p>
            <div class='grid1111-table'>
                <label>Region</label><label>Natural Proficiency</label><label>Weapons Permitted</label><label>Fighting Styles Permitted</label>
                <p>Mountain</p><p>Climbing</p><p>Battle axe, club, dagger, great axe, hand axe, shortbow, spear, sword, two-handed sword, war hammer</p><p>Weapon & shield, two-handed weapon</p>
                <p>Steppe</p><p>Precise Shooting</p><p>Composite bow, dagger, hand axe, javelin, lance, net, sling, short sword (scimitar), spear, whip</p><p>Weapon & shield, two weapons</p>
                <p>Savannah</p><p>Running</p><p>Bola, club, dart, dagger, hand axe, javelin, net, shortbow, short sword, spear</p><p>Weapon & shield, two weapons</p>
            </div>
            <p>Depending on his region of origin, every barbarian also possesses a natural proficiency in a particular area. These are bonus proficiencies that do not count against the barbarian’s normal selections. Barbarians from the north (or similar Scandinavian cultures) are skilled at climbing the sheer rock faces of their grim homeland. Barbarians from the steppes (or related steppe nomads) are preternaturally precise shots. Barbarians from the savannahs are swift and tireless runners. The Barbarian Regional Origin table lists these proficiencies. The Judge may devise other natural proficiencies for other barbarian regions in his own setting.</p>
            <p>Barbarians from every region possess animal reflexes that give them a +1 bonus to initiative and a +1 bonus to surprise rolls. As hunters and raiders by trade, barbarians are naturally stealthy, and  opponents suffer a -1 penalty to surprise rolls when encountering them. The healers and clerics of civilized lands are foreign to barbarians, who rely on their savage resilience to survive. When a barbarian is required to consult the Mortal Wounds table, the player may roll twice and choose the preferred result to apply. Barbarians also subtract their class level from the number of days of bed rest required to recover.</p>
            <p>When a barbarian reaches 5th level (Reaver), his animal magnetism begins to inspire those who follow him. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the barbarian gain a +1 bonus to their morale score whenever he personally leads them. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the barbarian’s Charisma or proficiencies.</p>
            <p>At 9th level (Warchief), a barbarian can build or claim a chieftain’s hall and seek to rule on the strength of his axe. When the barbarian establishes his hall, 1d4+1x10 0th level mercenaries and 1d6 barbarians of 1st-3rd level seeking plunder and rapine will join his service. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries. Barbarians’ halls are otherwise identical to fighters’ castles, as detailed in the Campaign chapter of the ACKS Rulebook.</p>

            <p>Bards advance in attack throws and saving throws as a thief, by two points every four levels of experience. At first level, bards hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They may fight with any missile weapons and any one-handed melee weapons, and may wield a weapon in each hand if desired. They cannot wear armor heavier than leather, and cannot use shields.</p>
            <p>All bards can sing, recite poetry, or play a group of instruments in a skilled manner. The bard chooses the type of performance that his character knows. A bard may take the Perform proficiency to learn other types of performances.</p>
            <p>By reciting heroic lays and epic poems, bards can inspire courage. Inspiring courage requires a few moments of oration before a battle (one round), and grants the bard’s allies within a 50' radius a +1 bonus to attack throws, damage rolls, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the bard), and saving throws against magical fear. The bonus lasts for 10 minutes (1 turn). A bard can inspire courage in any given character once per day per class level. (Even the most inspiring epic gets old if you hear it twice in the same day.) A bard cannot inspire courage on characters who are already engaged in combat.</p>
            <p>Because of their study of ancient annals and legends, bards possess loremastery. This knowledge allows them to decipher occult runes, remember ancient history, identify historic artifacts, and similar tasks. At 1st level, a bard must make a proficiency throw of 18+ on 1d20 to succeed in these tasks. The proficiency throw required reduces by 1 per level.</p>
            <p>This same knowledge allows bards to dabble in the arcane. They may attempt to use wands, staffs, and other magic items only useable by mages. At 1st level, the character must make a proficiency throw of 18+ on 1d20 or the attempt backfires in some desultory way (Judge’s discretion). The proficiency throw required reduces by 2 per level, to a minimum of 3+.</p>
            <p>Upon attaining 4th level (Annalist), the bard gains the ability to read languages, including ciphers, treasure maps, and dead languages, but not magical writings. A proficiency throw of 5+ on 1d20 is required. If the roll does not succeed, the bard may not try to read that particular piece of writing until he reaches a higher level of experience.</p>
            <p>When a bard reaches 5th level (Chronicler), his chronicles of battle inspire his hirelings to strive for glory. Any henchmen and mercenaries hired by the bard gain a +1 bonus to their morale score if the bard is there to witness and record their deeds. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the bard’s Charisma or proficiencies.</p>
            <p>Upon reaching 9th level (Bard), a bard can build a hall and become a ruler. When he does so, up to 1d4+1x10 0th level mercenaries and 1d6 bards of 1st-3rd level will come to apply for jobs and training. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries.</p>
            <p>At 10th level, the bard can read and cast magic from arcane scrolls with a proficiency throw of 3+ on 1d20. However, a failed throw means the spell does not function as expected, and can create a horrible effect at the Judge’s discretion.</p>

            <h5>Full Description</h5>
            <p>Bladedancers are skilled combatants. At first level, bladedancers hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance like clerics in attack throws and saving throws, by two points every four levels of experience. By religious doctrine, bladedancers are forbidden from debasing themselves with the fighting implements of the peasantry, or dishonorably firing missiles from a distance. A bladedancer may only use piercing and slashing melee weapons, such as daggers, swords, spears, and polearms. This eliminates weapons such as clubs, maces, and warhammers, as well as bows, slings, and crossbows. </p>
            <p>A bladedancer may wield a weapon in each hand, or fight with a two-handed weapon, but may not resort to shields. Bladedancers are only trained to fight in leather or lighter armor. However, they gain a +1 bonus to initiative and a +1 bonus to Armor Class if able to move freely. At level 7, the AC bonus increases to +2, and at level 13 the AC bonus increases to +3.</p>
            <p>A bladedancer may turn undead like a cleric. Starting at 2nd level, a bladedancer may cast divine spells. Bladedancers follow the same spell progression as clerics and use the same rules for learning and casting spells. However, a bladedancer’s spell list is slightly different than a cleric’s. Like clerics, bladedancers must uphold the doctrines of their faith and god, and suffer penalties if they violate them. </p>
            <p>When a bladedancer reaches 5th level (Blade-Sister), she may begin to research spells, scribe scrolls, and brew potions. At 9th level (Blade-Mistress), she is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs. At 11th level, a bladedancer may learn and cast ritual divine spells of great power (6th and 7th level), and craft magical constructs such as golems and animated statues. If chaotic, the bladedancer will become able to create necromantic servants and even become undead herself.</p>
            <p>When a bladedancer reaches 9th level (Blade-Mistress), she may choose to construct a temple as a stronghold. If she has not lost the favor of her deity, the cost of building the temple will be half the normal amount due to miraculous assistance from the bladedancer’s honored deity. Once the temple is completed, fanatically loyal bladedancers called the “faithful,” who need never check morale, will come to defend the Blade-Mistress. There will be 5d6x10 0th level soldiers armed with various weapons, plus another 1d6 bladedancers of 1st-3rd level to serve the order. While in the bladedancer’s service, her followers must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages.</p>

            <h5>Full Description</h5>
            <p>Clerics are skilled combatants, albeit not as good as fighters. At first level, clerics hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every four levels of experience (a progression midway between fighters and mages). As holy warriors, clerics are trained to wear any armor and fight with a variety of weapons.</p>
            <p>The particular weapons that clerics are trained to fight with are determined by the strictures of their religious order. If your Judge has not specified particular religious orders in his campaign, the default cleric is assumed to be a worshipper of Ammonar, God of Law and Light. Strict holy doctrine prevents these clerics from using any weapons that shed blood. The cleric of Ammonar may use only blunt weapons such as warhammers, maces, clubs, quarterstaffs, and slings. This cleric may use any shields or fight with two-handed weapons, but is not trained to fight with weapons in each hand (i.e. he may not ‘dual wield’).</p>
            <p>All clerics have the ability to turn undead, calling upon the name and power of their deity to turn away, and even destroy, undead. The potency of this ability is determined by level. There is no limit to how often a cleric may attempt to turn undead each day, but if an attempt to turn undead fails during an encounter, the cleric may not attempt to turn undead again for the remainder of that encounter. Turned undead flee the area for 10 rounds by the best and fastest means available to them. If they cannot flee, they cower in terror, taking no actions and suffering a -2 penalty to AC. If the cleric attacks turned undead in melee combat, the turning effect is broken, but he can use spells or missile weapons against them, and other characters may attack them in any fashion, without breaking the turning effect. Destroyed undead are immediately turned to ash.</p>
            <p>Certain chaotic sects teach their clerics to control undead rather than turn them. The undead are controlled for 1 turn per level of the cleric. If the undead would have been destroyed, the undead are controlled for 1 day per level of the cleric instead. Controlled undead behave as if charmed, obeying the cleric as if they were friends. However, if the controlled undead are turned or destroyed by a cleric during the duration of the control, the control is dispelled immediately. If the duration of the control ends without incident, the undead will flee (as if turned).</p>
            <p>Starting at 2nd level (Acolyte), clerics may manifest their deity’s power in the form of divine spells, which are granted through prayer and worship. The power and number of divine spells available to the character are determined by level according to the Cleric Spell Progression table.</p>
            <p>In order to use spells and turn undead, clerics must uphold the doctrines of their faith and god. If a cleric ever falls from favor, due to violating the beliefs of his god or breaking the rules of his clergy, the god may impose penalties upon the cleric. These penalties are entirely up to the Judge, but might include penalties to attack or a reduction in spells available.</p>
            <p>When a cleric reaches 5th level (Vicar), he may begin to research spells, scribe scrolls, and brew potions. At 9th level (Patriarch), he is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs. At 11th level, a cleric may learn and cast ritual divine spells of great power (6th and 7th level), and craft magical constructs such as golems and animated statues. If chaotic, the cleric will become able to create necromantic servants and even become undead himself. These activities are explained in the Campaign chapter.</p>
            <p>Upon attaining 9th level (Patriarch), a cleric may establish or build a fortified church. So long as the cleric is currently in favor with his god, he may buy or build his fortified church at half the normal price due to divine intervention. Once a fortified church is established, the cleric’s reputation will spread and he will attract 5d6x10 0th level soldiers armed with various weapons, plus another 1d6 clerics of 1st-3rd level of the same religion to serve the order. They are completely loyal (morale +4). While in the cleric’s service, his followers must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. The Judge determines which proportions of followers are archers, infantry, etc.</p>

            <p><em>Nothing is so revered among the dwarven people as craftsmanship. A dwarf’s work is his life, and the spirits of great dwarven artisans are believed to live on forever in their masterpieces. The veneration of these relics falls to the care of a caste of dwarves known as craftpriests. While most craftpriests attend to the shrines and monuments of their clan, young craftpriests are sometimes sent forth to recover monuments to the glorious past from the ancient ruins and wastelands of the world.

            <h5>Full Description</h5>
            <p>At first level, dwarven craftpriests hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Dwarven craftpriests advance in attack throws and saving throws as clerics, by two points every four levels of experience. Dwarven craftpriests may wear any armor and may use any of the traditional weapons of their people, including the battle axe, great axe, hand axe, flail, mace, morning star, and  warhammer. They are trained to fight wielding a weapon and shield or wielding a weapon twohanded, but may not dual wield weapons.</p>
            <p>A dwarven craftpriest may turn undead like a cleric. Starting at 2nd level (Craft-Acolyte), a craftpriest may cast divine spells. Craftpriests follow the same spell progression as clerics, use the same rules for learning and casting spells, and select their spells from the same spell list. See the Spells chapter for details. Because of their religious training, a craftpriest can automatically identify religious symbols, trappings, and holy days of the dwarven faith, and recognizes those of other faiths with a proficiency throw of 8+ on 1d20.</p>
            <p>In addition, each dwarven craftpriest is a journeyman in a particular type of craft (Craft proficiency, rank 2), such as armor-making, leatherworking, weapon-smithing, etc. With access to craftsman’s tools, the character can produce 20gp worth of items per month, and supervise 3 apprentices in his craft. When examining works of his craft, the craftpriest can identify masterwork items, rare materials, and famous artisans with a proficiency throw of 8+ on 1d20. Their attention to detail gives craftpriests a +3 bonus on proficiency rolls for other proficiencies they learn as well. </p>
            <p>Dwarves gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when underground due to sensitivity to the rock and stone around them. Because of their experience underground, dwarves may detect traps, false walls, hidden construction, or sloped passages with a proficiency throw of 14+ on 1d20. Dwarves must be actively searching for these abilities to function. In addition to these abilities, dwarves are particularly hardy people. The target values for all their saving throws versus Blast/Breath are reduced by 3, while the target values for all their other saving throws are reduced by 4. Dwarven characters speak the Common and Dwarvish tongue and, because of their frequent interaction underground with these monsters, also speak Goblin, Gnome, and Kobold.</p>
            <p>Starting at 5th level (Craft-Vicar), a craftpriest may begin to research spells, scribe scrolls, and brew potions. At 9th level (Craft-Lord), he is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs, and craft magical constructs such as golems. At 9th level, he also can construct a vault that will attract dwarves from far and wide. Dwarves of the character’s clan will be the first to live under his roof, but dwarves from other clans will also come and live nearby to be ruled by the character. A total of 3d6x10 1st level NPCs of the same race will move in to help maintain and defend the vault at no cost to the character. A Craft-Lord is expected to employ only soldiers of dwarven descent, but may hire members of other races for other tasks.</p>

Even the most exhaustive of dwarven maps has charted only a fraction of these tunnels, and most have never been trod by dwarven boots. The dwarven delver is one of the brave few dwarves that explore and map these sepulchral lands, so far from the warm forges of home. Confronted by the perils of cave-ins, beastmen, and dark threats unknown to the light of day, few delvers survive their first expedition. This only adds to the renown of those who do, attracting a new generation of foolhardy young dwarves to the perils of the darkness below.</em></p>

            <h5>Full Description</h5>
            <p>Dwarven delvers are able combatants. Like thieves, they advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every four levels of experience. At first level, delvers hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They may fight wielding a weapon in either hand or a wielding a weapon two-handed, but cannot use shields. Valuing mobility and stealth over the false security of heavy armor, delvers wear only leather armor or lighter. They are trained to fight with all missile weapons and all axes, hammers, flails, and maces. They may use any magic item usable by thieves.</p>
            <p>Dwarven delvers have several skills in common with the class of thieves, although these skills are not commonly employed for criminal enterprises. Because dwarven delvers prefer to evade foes where possible, they learn to hide in shadows and move silently. Chasms, sinkholes, and chimneys abound in the subterranean world, so every delver also learns climb walls. Decades of training in lightless environments teach delvers to hear noises that others miss. Subterranean dwellers are notorious for creating deadfalls, pits, and snares to capture or kill unwary trespassers, so dwarven delvers become expert at finding traps. (Unlike thieves, delvers generally avoid or bypass traps, and have no skill at disarming them.) Finally, a dwarven delver who catches an opponent unaware of his presence, either by surprise or by moving silently and/or hiding in shadows, may backstab.</p>
            <p>By necessity, all dwarven delver are expert cavers, able to keep maps in their heads of where they are when exploring underground caves, cavern complexes, and rivers. On a proficiency throw of 9+, a delver will be able to automatically know the route he has taken to get where he is, if he was conscious at the time.</p>
            <p>Dwarven delvers gain a +1 bonus on all surprise rolls when underground due to sensitivity to the rock and stone around them.</p>
            <p>When underground a delver can detect false walls, hidden construction, or sloped passages with a proficiency throw of 14+ on 1d20, if actively searching. Like all dwarves, delvers are hardy people. The target values for all their saving throws versus Blast/Breath are reduced by 3, while the target values for all their other saving throws are reduced by 4. Dwarven delvers will speak the Common and Dwarvish tongue and, because of their frequent interaction underground with these monsters, will also speak Goblin, Gnome, and Kobold.</p>
            <p>When a dwarven delver reaches 9th level (Dwarven Pioneer), his reputation is such that he can attract dwarves from far and wide by constructing a new underground vault in an unsettled region. Dwarves usually live in clans, so dwarves of the character’s clan will be the first to live under his roof, but dwarves from other clans will also come and live nearby to be ruled by the character. A total of 3d6x10 1st level NPCs of the same race will move in to help maintain and defend the vault at no cost to the character. A dwarven delver is expected to employ only soldiers of dwarven descent, but may hire members of other races for other tasks. A delver’s vault follows all the rules for dwarven vaults detailed in the Dwarven Vaults section of Chapter 7 of ACKS.</p>

            <p><em>As the numbers of their race have dwindled in the face of constant warfare, more and more the dwarves have been forced to rely on the machinists’ arts, using war machines of steam and brass to defend their vaults. Some dwarves, however, have rejected this mechanization of warfare and returned to an older tradition of runic magic and savage combat. Instantly recognizable by the magical tattoos that scar their skin, these dwarves are known as furies. It is said that once the fury grips a dwarf, his destiny is to die with axe in hand, and the only question is how many beastman corpses will surround his own on the final day.</em></p>

            <h5>Full Description</h5>
            <p>Dwarven furies excel at combat. At first level, furies hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience (i.e. the same progression as fighters). They increase their base damage roll from all attacks by +1 at 1st level and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level.</p>
            <p>Dwarven furies fight with a narrow selection of traditional dwarven weapons, including any axes, flails, hammers, maces, and war hammers. They are trained to fight wielding a weapon and shield, wielding a weapon two-handed, and wielding a weapon in each hand.</p>
            <p>Dwarven furies eschew the use of armor entirely, however, relying on their aggression and flesh-runes to protect them. Intricate glyphs tattooed into the naked flesh of the dwarf, the flesh-runes give the dwarf’s skin the suppleness of leather and the toughness of iron. At 1st level, a dwarven fury’s flesh-runes give him a +2 bonus to AC and decrease the damage from any non-magical attacks by 1 point per die. At 7th level (Dwarven Scourge), this protection increases to +4 AC and 2 points per die. At 13th level (Dwarven Avenger), the flesh-runes provide a bonus of +6 AC (equivalent to plate armor!) and decrease damage from non-magical attacks by 3 points per die.</p>
            <p>The damage reduction is applied per die. Damage can be reduced to 0, but not less than 0, on each die. The AC bonus from flesh-runes stacks with potions of invulnerability, rings of protection, and similar effects, but does not stack with armor. Attacks from monsters of 5 HD or more are considered magical attacks due to the monster’s ferocity.</p>
            <p>At will, dwarven furies can enter into the fighting fury from which they derive their name. While furious, the dwarven fury gains a +2 bonus to damage rolls and becomes immune to fear. However, the character cannot retreat from combat. Once it has begun, a fighting fury cannot be ended until combat ends.</p>
            <p>Similarly to barbarians, dwarven furies enjoy savage resilience. When a dwarven fury is required to consult the Mortal Wounds table, the player may roll twice and choose the preferred result to apply. Dwarven furies also subtract their class level from the number of days of bed rest required to recover.</p>
            <p>Like all dwarves, furies are hardy people. The target values for all their saving throws versus Blast/Breath are reduced by 3, while the target values for all their other saving throws are reduced by 4. Dwarven furies will speak the Common and Dwarvish tongue and, because of their frequent interaction underground with these monsters, will also speak Goblin, Gnome, and Kobold. Dwarven furies gain a +1 bonus on all surprise rolls when underground due to sensitivity to the rock and stone around them. When underground a fury can detect false walls, hidden construction, or sloped passages with a proficiency throw of 14+ on 1d20, if actively searching.</p>
            <p>When a dwarven fury reaches 9th level (Dwarven Avenger), his grim determination and relentless nature can attract dwarves from far and wide. To do so, he must construct his own underground vault. Dwarves usually live in clans, so dwarves of the character’s clan will be the first to live under his roof, but dwarves from other clans will also come and live nearby to be ruled by the character. A total of 3d6x10 1st level NPCs of the same race will move in to help maintain and defend the vault at no cost to the character. A dwarven ruler is expected to employ only soldiers of dwarven descent, but may hire members of other races for other tasks.</p>

            <h5>Full Description</h5>
            <p>Relative to the renowned vaultguards of their race, dwarven machinists are only mediocre combatants. At first level, machinists hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every four levels of experience (i.e. the same as thieves). They may fight wielding a weapon and shield or a wielding a weapon two-handed, but cannot dual wield. Machinists may wear chain mail or lighter armor, but wield only a small range of weapons, including the arbalest, crossbow, dagger, hand axe, mace, and war hammer. They may use any magic item usable by thieves.</p>
            <p>It is not in combat, but in the construction and engineering of mechanical devices, that the true mastery of the dwarven machinist becomes evident. At 1st level, every dwarven machinist is already a master craftsman (Craft proficiency, rank 3) in a particular type of mechanical craft, such as armor-making, clock-making, jewelling, weaponsmithing, etc. Their attention to detail gives dwarven machinists a +3 bonus on proficiency rolls for other proficiencies they learn as well.</p>
            <p>Regardless of their particular craft, all machinists are able to open locks and find/remove traps in the same manner as thieves, but doing so with a superior rate of success due to their attention to detail. Note that a 1st level machinist will have a minimum chance of detecting traps of 14+ due to his default racial ability (described below), but will remove traps with a throw of 15+. </p>
            <p>The most precious and valued secret of the dwarven machinist is his ability to design, build, and repair automatons. Automatons are machines similar to magical constructs, but using clockwork, steam engines, gears, and valves in place of dweomercraft. For more information, see ACKS Player's Companion, pgs. 18-20.</p>
            <p>When a dwarven machinist reaches 9th level (Master Machinist), he can establish a manufactory and begin training apprentices. He will then attract 1d6 apprentice machinists of 1st-3rd level plus 2d6 dwarves seeking to become machinists. Their Intelligence and Dexterity scores will be above average, but many will find they lack the talent and quit after 1d6 months. Apprentices function like assistants in magical research (see ACKS p. 119). While in the dwarven machinist’s service, apprentices must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. If the dwarven machinist builds a dungeon beneath or near his manufactory, monsters will start to arrive to dwell within. These are often used to test new automatons. Machinists’ manufactories are otherwise identical to mages’ sanctums, as detailed in the Campaign chapter of the ACKS Rulebook. </p>
            <p>Like other dwarves, machinists gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when underground due to sensitivity to the rock and stone around them. Because of their experience underground, dwarves may detect traps, false walls, hidden construction, or sloped passages with a proficiency throw of 14+ on 1d20. Dwarves must be actively searching for these abilities to function. As dwarves, machinists are particularly hardy. The target values for all their saving throws versus Blast/Breath are reduced by 3, while the target values for all their other saving throws are reduced by 4. Dwarven machinists will speak the Common and Dwarvish tongue and, because of their frequent interaction underground with these monsters, dwarves can also speak Goblin, Gnome, and Kobold.</p>

            <h5>Full Description</h5>
            <p>Though not specialized in fighting, elven courtiers are comfortable with weapons. At first level, elven courtiers hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Elven courtiers thereafter advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every four levels of experience (i.e. as thieves). Elven courtiers are trained to fight with swords, shortswords, daggers, composite bows, spears, and lances, and to wear chain mail or lighter armor. They may wield a weapon and shield or a weapon in each hand, but may not wield a weapon two-handed. All courtiers receive classical weapons training giving them a bonus of +1 to attack throws with their choice of melee or missile attacks. The courtier must choose which type of attack will receive the bonus at 1st level, and may not change the choice as he advances.</p>
            <p>As patricians of their race, elven courtiers are of course taught the arcane arts, but it is not their focus. Elven courtiers cast arcane spells as mages of one-half their level, using the same spell list and the same rules for learning and casting spells. Unlike (human) mages, elven courtiers can also cast spells while wearing armor. They can use any magical items available to mages or thieves.</p>
            <p>As befits their noble upbringing, elven courtiers are wellschooled in diplomacy and protocol. They receive a +2 bonus on all reaction rolls when they attempt to parley with intelligent creatures (as per the Diplomacy proficiency). This same upbringing gives them the leadership skills and self-confidence to inspire courage in their allies, in the same manner as bards. Inspiring courage requires a few moments of oration before a battle (one round), and grants the courtier’s allies within a 50' radius a +1 bonus to attack throws, damage rolls, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and saving throws against magical fear. The bonus lasts for 10 minutes (1 turn). A courtier can inspire courage in any given character once per day per class level. (Even the most inspiring epic gets old if you hear it twice in the same day.) A courtier cannot inspire courage on characters who are already engaged in combat.</p>
            <p>From childhood, courtiers are taught to either sing, recite poetry, or play a group of instruments in a skilled manner. The courtier chooses the type of performance that his character knows. He may take the Perform proficiency to learn other types of performances.</p>
            <p>Such training lays the ground work for courtiers to work magic with their song and poetry. At will, the character can conduct a performance that can serenade creatures with a potential prurient interest (as a charm person spell) or quiet savage beasts (as a sleep spell, but it only functions on ordinary and giant animals of 4 HD or less). These abilities require one minute (6 rounds) of performance and may not be used if combat has already begun.</p>
            <p>Like other elves, courtiers gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when in the wilderness due to their attunement to nature. Elves have keen eyes that allow them to detect hidden and secret doors with a proficiency throw of 8+ on 1d20 when actively searching, or 14+ on casual inspection. Because of their connection to nature, elves are completely unaffected by the paralysis ghouls can inflict, and the target values for all their saving throws versus Petrification/Paralysis and Spells are reduced by 1. Elves can speak the Common, Elven, Gnoll, Hobgoblin, and Orc languages.</p>
            <p>When an elven courtier reaches 9th level (Lord), he is expected to establish a fastness in a natural setting, such as a forest or glen, to further his family’s lineage. A total of 3d6x10 1st level elven NPCs will move in to help with it and defend the fastness at no cost to the character.</p>

            <p><em>Human legend paints the elves as bewitching and glamorous, yet tricky and untrustworthy. This reputation is not entirely undeserved, for the favorite dweomers of the elves are charms and illusions. The elven enchanter is a specialist in such glamours, one who can weave subtle marvels of light and sound, torment the senses with phantasms and figments, and confound the minds of the easily influenced. Elven enchanters might be called to adventure by a desire to experience awe and terror, a quest for rare and forgotten magic, or merely the lure of opulence.</em></p>

            <h5>Class Proficiencies</h5>
            <p>Beast Friendship, Bribery, Careful Overcaster, Combat Trickery (Disarm, Sunder), Command, Eavesdropping, Familiar, Fighting Style, Healing, Hedge Wizardry, Knowledge (political history), Laying on Hands, Leadership, Loremastery, Magical Engineering, Master of Overcasting, Military Strategy, Mystic Aura, Naturalism, Overcasting Prodigy, Passing Without Trace, Performance, Precise Shooting, Prestidigitation, Profession (seneschal), Quiet Magic, Riding, Sensing Power, Skirmishing, Swashbuckling, Unflappable Casting, Wakefulness, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus</p>
            <h5>Full Description</h5>
            <p>Like mages, elven enchanters receive limited combat training. At first level, enchanters hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws only two points every six levels of experience (i.e. the same as mages). They may only fight with quarterstaffs, daggers, darts, or slings. They are unable to use shields, fight with two weapons, or wear any kind of armor.</p>
            <p>Elven enchanters learn and cast arcane spells as mages. The number and levels of spells the enchanter can use in a single day is summarized on the Elven Enchanter Spell Progression table. Like a mage, the enchanter’s spell selection is limited to the spells in his repertoire. An enchanter’s repertoire can include a number of spells up to the number and level of spells listed for his level, increased by his Intelligence bonus. An enchanter can use any magic items usable by mages.</p>
            <p>The elven enchanter’s mastery of charms and illusions gives him several advantages. When the character casts charm spells (such as charm person) or illusion spells (such as phantasmal force), the spell effects are calculated as if he were two class levels higher than his actual level of experience. Targets of his charm spells suffer a -2 penalty to their saving throw, as do those who attempt to disbelieve his illusions.</p>
            <p>All enchanters can magically accomplish simple illusions and sleight of hand tricks suitable for impressing peasants, such as lighting a candle or shuffling cards, at will. To cast these prestidigitations, the enchanter must be able to perform the task physically, and be free to speak and gesture. He may use magical sleight-of-hand to pick pockets as a thief of one half his class level.</p>
            <p>Every elven enchanter is able to project a glamorous aura that awes, bedazzles and seduces those in his presence. He gains a +2 bonus to reaction rolls to impress and intimidate people he encounters. If this bonus results in a total of 12 or more, the subjects act as if charmed while in his presence.</p>
            <p>Like other elves, the enchanter gains a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when in the wilderness due to their attunement to nature. Elves have keen eyes that allow them to detect hidden and secret doors with a proficiency throw of 8+ on 1d20 when actively searching, or 14+ on casual inspection. Because of their connection to nature, elves are completely unaffected by the paralysis ghouls can inflict, and the target values for all their saving throws versus Petrification/Paralysis and Spells are reduced by 1. Elves can speak the Common, Elven, Gnoll, Hobgoblin, and Orc languages.</p>
            <p>When an elven enchanter reaches 5th level (Spellbinder), he may begin to research spells, scribe magical scrolls, and brew potions. When an elven enchanter reaches 9th level (Enchanter), he is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs.</p>
            <p>An elven enchanter may also build a sanctum, often a great tower, when he reaches 9th level. He will then attract 1d6 apprentices of 1st-3rd level plus 2d6 elves seeking to become enchanters. Their Intelligence scores will be above average, but many will become discouraged from the rigorous mental training and quit after 1d6 months. While in the elven enchanter’s service, apprentices must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. If the elven enchanter builds a dungeon beneath or near his tower, monsters will start to arrive to dwell within, followed shortly by adventurers seeking to fight them.</p>
            <p>At 11th level, an elven enchanter may learn and cast ritual arcane spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level), craft magical constructs, and create magical cross-breeds. If chaotic, the enchanter may create necromantic servants and become undead, though such a choice is understandably rarer among the ageless elves.</p>

            <h5>Full Description</h5>
            <p>At first level, elven nightblades hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Elven nightblades advance in attack throws and saving throws as thieves, by two points every four levels of experience. They may use any missile weapons and any one-handed melee weapons. They may fight with a one-handed weapon in each hand, or wielding a one-handed weapon with two hands. They cannot wear armor heavier than leather, and cannot use shields or exclusively two-handed melee weapons such as great axes or polearms.</p>
            <p>Elven nightblades have the following range of thieving skills:
                <ul>
                <li>Moving Silently: Nightblades may move with total silence. When successful, even keen eared guards will not hear the movements of a nightblade. However, the nightblade always thinks he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise unless and until others react to his presence. Nightblades may move silently at ½ their standard combat movement rate without penalty. If they move greater than ½ speed, they take a -5 penalty to the proficiency throw. If they run, they take a -10 penalty.</li>
                <li>Climbing Walls: Nightblades are adept at scaling sheer surfaces, including walls or steep cliffs. They require a proficiency throw for each 100' they intend to climb. If the roll fails, they fall a distance equal to half the attempted distance, plus the distance covered by any previous throws, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet. Nightblades climb at ¼ their standard combat movement rate.</li>
                <li>Hiding in Shadows: A nightblade may attempt to skulk unseen in the cover of darkness. A nightblade will always think he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise until others react to his presence. A nightblade will remain hidden so long as he stays motionless. If he moves, he must make a new proficiency throw to hide.</li>
                <li>A nightblade also has the ability to backstab. He must catch an opponent unaware of his presence, either by surprise or by moving silently and/or hiding in shadows to sneak up on his opponent. When backstabbing, the nightblade will receive an attack bonus of +4 and, if successful, deal additional damage for every four levels he has attained.</li>
                <li>In addition, nightblades may perform feats of acrobatics. In lieu of moving during a round, the nightblade may attempt a proficiency throw to tumble behind an opponent in melee. If successful, the nightblade is now behind his opponent. The opponent loses the benefit of his shield, if any, and the nightblade can backstab his opponent.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Elven nightblades cast spells as mages of one-half their level, using the same spell list and the same rules for learning and casting spells. Unlike (human) mages, elven nightblades can also cast spells while wearing armor. They can use any magical items available to mages or thieves.</p>
            <p>Elves gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when in the wilderness due to their attunement to nature. Elves have keen eyes that allow them to detect hidden and secret doors with a proficiency throw of 8+ on 1d20 when actively searching, or 14+ on casual inspection. Because of their connection to nature, elves are completely unaffected by the paralysis ghouls can inflict, and the target values for all their saving throws versus Spells, Paralysis, and Petrification are reduced by 1. Elves can speak Common, Elven, Gnoll, Hobgoblin, and Orc languages.</p>
            <p>When they reach 9th level (Nightblade), elven nightblades may construct a hideout. When a nightblade builds a hideout, he will gain 2d6 1st level nightblades as apprentices, come to learn under a master. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for ruffians. These nightblades will serve the character with some loyalty, though at least one will be an infiltrator working for the elven nightblade’s local rivals, sent to keep an eye on the character.</p>
            <p>When they reach 10th level, elven nightblades may begin to research spells, scribe magical scrolls, and brew potions, as if they were 5th level mages.</p>

            <p><em>Elven rangers are sharp-eyed archers with a light tread and a deep connection to nature.

Such is their reputation that few dare trespass the elven forests, so elven rangers sometimes become adventurers out of wanderlust or boredom.

            <h5>Full Description</h5>
            <p>Highly trained combatants, elven rangers advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience (i.e. the same as fighters). At first level, elven rangers hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. Elven rangers are trained to fight with any missile weapons and any one-handed melee weapons. They may fight wielding a weapon two-handed, wielding a weapon in each hand, or wielding a weapon and shield. They may wear only chain mail or lighter armor. They may use any magic item usable by fighters.</p>
            <p>While they lack the staying power of human fighters or dwarven vaultguards (evidenced by their 1d6 Hit Dice), elven rangers are renowned as the best archers in the world. Due to their careful aim, they increase their base damage roll from successful missile attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. Their accuracy gives them a +1 bonus on all attack throws with missile weapons. Rangers are universally precise shots, able to conduct missile attacks against opponents engaged in melee at a -4 penalty to their attack throws. (An elven archer may take ranks in the Precise Shooting proficiency to reduce this penalty to -2 or less).</p>
            <p>Like explorers, elven rangers are difficult to spot in the wilderness, having the ability to seemingly disappear into woods and underbrush with a proficiency throw of 3+ on 1d20. In dungeons, an elven ranger who is motionless and quiet in cover can escape detection with a proficiency throw of 14+ on 1d20.</p>
            <p>From years of hunting down trespassers to their demesnes, elven rangers become highly skilled trackers. A ranger can follow tracks with a proficiency throw of 11+ (applying modifiers as per the Tracking proficiency). If desired, an elven ranger may select the Tracking proficiency to improve his skills. Each rank of Tracking proficiency reduces the proficiency throw required to track by 4.</p>
            <p>As friends of birds and beasts, elven rangers can understand the subtle body language and moods of normal animals (though the animals may not understand the character). This gives rangers a +2 to all reaction rolls when encountering normal animals, and allows them to take animals as henchmen. They also can identify flora and fauna with a proficiency throw of 11+.</p>
            <p>Elven rangers possess animal reflexes that give them a +1 bonus to initiative and a +1 bonus to surprise rolls. They gain an additional +1 bonus to surprise rolls (for a total bonus of +2) when in the wilderness due to their attunement to nature. Like other elves, they have keen eyes that allow them to detect hidden and secret doors with a proficiency throw of 8+ on 1d20 when actively searching, or 14+ on casual inspection. Because of their connection to nature, elven rangers are completely unaffected by the paralysis ghouls can inflict, and the target values for all their saving throws versus Spells, Paralysis, and Petrification are reduced by 1. Elven rangers can speak Common and Elven, as well as the languages of the forestdwelling beastmen, Gnoll, Hobgoblin, and Orc.</p>
            <p>When an elven ranger reaches 9th level (Ranger), he can establish a fastness in a natural setting, such as a forest or glen. Rather than impose upon nature, this fastness must blend seamlessly with it. A total of 3d6x10 1st level elven NPCs will move in to help with it and defend the fastness at no cost to the character.</p>

            <p>Elven spellswords learn an elegant, deadly style of fighting. At first level, elven spellswords hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws as fighters, by two points every three levels of experience. They increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, and 9th level. Elven spellswords can wield any weapon and wear any armor. They are trained to fight wielding a weapon and shield, wielding a two-handed weapon, and wielding a weapon in each hand.</p>
            <p>In addition to their fighting prowess, elven spellswords cast spells like a mage, using the same spell list and the same rules for learning and casting spells. Elven spellswords follow the same spell progression as mages up to 10th level. Unlike (human) mages, elven spellswords can also cast spells while wearing armor. They can use any magic item available to fighters or mages.</p>
            <p>Elves gain a +1 bonus to surprise rolls when in the wilderness due to their attunement to nature. Elves have keen eyes that allow them to detect hidden and secret doors with a proficiency throw of 8+ on 1d20 when actively searching, or 14+ on casual inspection. Because of their connection to nature, elves are completely unaffected by the paralysis ghouls can inflict, and the target values for all their saving throws versus Petrification/Paralysis and Spells are reduced by 1. Elves can speak the Common, Elven, Gnoll, Hobgoblin, and Orc languages.</p>
            <p>Starting at 5th level (Thaumaturge-Exemplar), elven spellswords may begin to research spells, scribe scrolls, and brew potions. When an elven spellsword reaches 9th level (Wizard-Lord), he is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs.</p>
            <p>At 9th level (Wizard-Lord), elven spellswords can also establish a fastness in a natural setting, such as a forest or glen. Rather than impose upon nature, this keep must blend seamlessly with it. A total of 3d6x10 1st level elven NPCs will move in to help with it and defend the fastness at no cost to the character.</p>

            <h5>Full Description</h5>
            <p>While they prefer to evade foes where possible, explorers are cunning warriors when they need to be. Like fighters, they advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every three levels of experience. At first level, explorers hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. In addition, they gain an accuracy bonus of +1 to all attack throws with missile weapons. Due to their careful aim, they increase their base damage roll from successful missile and melee attacks by +1 at 1st level, and by an additional +1 at 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th level. Explorers are trained to fight with any missile weapons and any one-handed melee weapons, and may wear chain mail or lighter armor. They may fight wielding a weapon and shield, wielding a weapon two-handed, and wielding a weapon in each hand.</p>
            <p>Explorers have animal reflexes, gaining +1 bonus to initiative and a +1 bonus to surprise rolls. Outdoors, explorers are difficult to spot, having the ability to seemingly disappear into woods and underbrush with a proficiency throw of 3+ on 1d20. In dungeons, an explorer who is motionless and quiet in cover can escape detection with a proficiency throw of 14+ on 1d20. </p>
            <p>Parties guided by explorers gain significant advantages on wilderness adventures. Any time the explorer’s party is in country familiar to the explorer, they get a +4 bonus on proficiency throws to avoid getting lost. In any terrain except clear and grassland terrain, the explorer’s party receives a +5 bonus to proficiency throws to evade wilderness encounters. A party guided by an explorer can evade wilderness encounters even when surprised on a proficiency throw of 19+.</p>
            <p>When an explorer reaches 5th level (Guide), his experience and hardiness reassures those who follow him into the wild. Hirelings on a wilderness adventure led by the explorer gain a +1 bonus to their morale score. This bonus stacks with any modifiers from the explorer’s Charisma or proficiencies. When an explorer reaches 9th level (Warden), he may decide to build a border fort in the borderlands or wilderness. When he does so, up to 1d4+1 x10 0th level mercenaries and 1d6 explorers of 1st–3rd level will come to apply for jobs and training. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for mercenaries. The character becomes the warden of any nearby settlers, and will attract more settlers over time. These people will look to the Warden as their leader, responsible for the growth and safety of their settlement.</p>

            <p>At 9th level (Warlord), a fighter can, assuming enough gold is at hand, build a castle and become a great leader of men, taking a leadership rank in his society.

            <p><em>Once upon a time, a curious sage invited an experienced adventurer to explain the differences between gnomes and their ancient ancestors, the dwarves and the elves. The adventurer, who had been on many expeditions in the company of gnomes, thought for a while, and responded thusly: “The difference between a gnome and a dwarf is that a gnome tells jokes. The difference between a gnome and an elf is that a gnome’s jokes are practical.”</em></p>
            <p><em>The adventurer’s laconic humor is not without factual basis. While gnomes live and work in underground vaults much like dwarves, they possess a very un-dwarven love for slapstick and outlandishness, for illusions, mummery, and convoluted practical jokes. No gnome embodies these traits more than the cunning and roguish gnomish trickster. Indeed, the gnomish reputation is perhaps worse than it ought be because tricksters are over-represented within the adventuring population. Whether this is because tricksters represent a gypsy-like class of wandering peddlers, because tricksters often get exiled from the gnomish vaults for one gaff too many, or because adventurers are simply far too fun to tease awaits further study.</em></p>

            <h5>Full Description</h5>
            <p>Gnomish tricksters are rogues who hate stand-up fights. They advance in attack throws as thieves, by two points every four levels of experience, while advancing in saving throws as fighters, by two points every three levels of experience. At first level, tricksters hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They may fight with arbalests, crossbows, daggers, shortbows, short swords, or war hammers. They may fight with a weapon in each hand but may not use shields or fight with a weapon two-handed. They cannot wear armor heavier than leather. When a gnomish trickster attacks with surprise, he gets a +4 bonus on his attack throws and deals double damage on the attack on the ambush.</p>
            <p>The gnomish trickster earns his name from his variety of spell-like abilities, with which he can befuddle, confuse, and dazzle his opponents. At will, gnomish tricksters can perform prestidigitations, such as lighting a candle or shuffling cards. To perform these simple illusions and sleights of hand, the gnomish trickster must be able to perform the task physically, and be free to speak and gesture. He may use magical sleight-of-hand to pick pockets as a thief of one half his class level.</p>
            <p>Once per hour, gnomish tricksters can cast faerie fire and ventriloquism. Once per 8 hours they can cast mirror image and phantasmal force, and once per day, they can cast chimerical force. Each of these spells takes one round to cast, and otherwise functions like a normal spell cast by a mage of his class level. A lifetime of such trickery leaves gnomish tricksters resistant to illusions made by others. They receive a +4 bonus on saving throws to disbelieve magical illusions.</p>
            <p>As they advance, gnomish tricksters progress into casting arcane spells, although their dwarven ancestry prohibits them from ever achieving true mastery. Starting at 2nd level (Gnomish Knave), they will learn and cast spells as mages of one-half their level, using the same spell list and the same rules for learning and casting spells. Unlike (human) mages, gnomish tricksters can also cast spells while wearing armor. They can use any magical items permitted to fighters, thieves, or mages.</p>
            <p>Whenever the trickster casts illusion spells or uses any of his innate powers, he has innate illusion mastery. The spell effects are calculated as if the character were two class levels higher than his actual level of experience. Attempts to disbelieve illusions created by the trickster are at a -2 penalty on the saving throw. The trickster may also conduct magical research into illusion spells as if he were two caster levels higher than actual.</p>
            <p>In addition to their adroitness with illusions, gnomish tricksters have a nose for potions. They may make a proficiency throw of 11+ to determine the magical properties of a potion or oil on taste. Starting at 5th level (Gnomish Scapegrace) gnomish tricksters may brew potions as if mages of their class level. At 10th level (Gnomish Mastermind), gnomish tricksters may scribe scrolls and research spells as if they were 5th level mages.</p>
            <p>Tricksters also have certain other powers due to their race. The gnomish tendency to underground life has granted them extended infravision to 90'. Like all gnomes, tricksters will speak the tongues of Dwarves, Elves, Goblins, and Kobolds. In addition, gnomes can speak with animals (as the spell) at will.</p>
            <p>A gnomish trickster who achieves enough fame and fortune from his adventures may build a gnomish vault when he reaches 9th level (Gnomish Mastermind). Gnomes usually live in clans, so gnomes of the character’s clan will be the first to live under his roof, but gnomes from other clans will also come and live nearby to be ruled by the character. A total of 3d6x10 1st level NPCs of the same race will move in to help maintain and defend the vault at no cost to the character. A gnomish trickster is expected to employ only soldiers of gnomish descent, but may hire members of other races for other tasks.</p>

            <h5>Full Description</h5>
            <p>Because of their devotion to arcane study, mages receive limited combat training. At first level, mages hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws only two points every six levels of experience (i.e., half as fast as fighters). They may only fight with quarterstaffs, clubs, daggers, and darts. They are unable to use shields, fight with two weapons, or wear any kind of armor. For these reasons, mages are quite vulnerable to physical danger, and in an adventuring group they should be protected.</p>
            <p>In exchange for these weaknesses, mages can learn and cast many powerful arcane spells. The number and levels of spells the mage can use in a single day increases with class level. A mage’s spell selection is limited to the spells in his repertoire. A mage’s repertoire can include a number of spells up to the number and level of spells listed for his level, increased by his Intelligence bonus. </p>
            <p>When a mage reaches 5th level (Thaumaturge), he may begin to research spells, scribe magical scrolls, and brew potions. When a mage reaches 9th level (Wizard), he is able to create more powerful magic items such as weapons, rings, and staffs. A mage may also build a sanctum, often a great tower, when he reaches 9th level. He will then attract 1d6 apprentices of 1st-3rd level plus 2d6 normal men seeking to become mages. Their intelligence scores will be above average, but many will become discouraged from the rigorous mental training and quit after 1d6 months. While in the mage’s service, apprentices must be provided food and lodging, but need not be paid wages. If the mage builds a dungeon beneath or near his tower, monsters will start to arrive to dwell within, followed shortly by adventurers seeking to fight them.</p>
            <p>At 11th level, a mage may learn and cast ritual arcane spells of great power (7th, 8th, and 9th level), craft magical constructs, and create magical cross-breeds. If chaotic, the mage may create necromantic servants and become undead.</p>

            <p><em>Thieves have a range of unique skills associated with their profession that make them very handy companions in adventures. However, thieves can be a bit shady and they sometimes are not as trustworthy as other classes. A thief will usually belong to a Thieves’ Guild from the character’s local town, where he can seek shelter and information between adventures. At the Judge’s discretion, a thief may have to forfeit a portion of his earnings to the guild in exchange for protection. Thieves are everywhere, from the slums of the ports to the highest halls of government.</em></p>

            <h5>Full Description</h5>
            <p>Thieves are trained combatants, although not as skilled as fighters. At first level, thieves hit an unarmored foe (AC 0) with an attack throw of 10+. They advance in attack throws and saving throws by two points every four levels of experience. Because of their need for stealth and free movement, thieves cannot wear armor heavier than leather, and cannot use shields or exclusively two-handed melee weapons such as great axes or polearms. They may use any missile weapons and any one-handed melee weapons. They may fight with a one-handed weapon in each hand, or wielding a one-handed weapon with two hands. </p>
            <p>A thief also has the ability to backstab. He must catch an opponent unaware of his presence, either by surprise or by moving silently and/or hiding in shadows to sneak up on his opponent. When backstabbing, the thief will receive an attack bonus of +4 and, if successful, deal additional damage for every four levels he has attained.</p>
            <p>Thieves have the following range of skills:
                <ul>
                <li>Opening Locks: With the aid of thieves’ tools, a thief may pick mechanical locks. He may only try to pick a particular lock once, and if he fails, he may not try the same lock again until he reaches a higher experience level. The Judge may apply bonuses or penalties to the roll, depending on the complexity of the lock.</li>
                <li>Finding and Removing Traps: Through careful inspection and probing, a thief may find hidden traps and then attempt to disable or discharge the trap harmlessly. A thief may only try to find or remove a trap once in any given area. The Judge may apply bonuses or penalties to the roll, depending on the complexity of the trap. If the thief fails, he may not try again until he reaches a higher experience level. Note that these are separate skills, for a thief must find a trap before he can remove it.</li>
                <li>Picking Pockets: This skill is the bread and butter of nonadventuring thieves for it is a quick source of income – though not without peril. A throw that is less than half the target value means that the intended target notices the thieving attempt. The Judge will then make a reaction roll with a -3 penalty to determine the intended victim’s reaction.</li>
                <li>Moving Silently: Thieves may move with total silence. When successful, even keen eared guards will not hear the movements of a thief. However, the thief always thinks he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise unless and until others react to his presence. Thieves may move silently at ½ their standard combat movement rate without penalty. If they move greater than ½ speed, they take a -5 penalty to the proficiency throw. If they run, they take a -10 penalty.</li>
                <li>Climbing Walls: Thieves are adept at scaling sheer surfaces, including walls or steep cliffs. They require a proficiency throw for each 100' they intend to climb. If the roll fails, they fall a distance equal to half the attempted distance, plus the distance covered by any previous throws, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet. Thieves climb at ¼ their standard combat movement rate.</li>
                <li>Hiding in Shadows: A thief may attempt to skulk unseen in the cover of darkness. A thief will always think he is successful in this skill, and will not know otherwise until others react to his presence. A thief will remain hidden so long as he stays motionless. If he moves, he must make a new proficiency throw to hide.</li>
                <li>Hearing Noises: Thieves can attempt to listen for noises in a cave or hallway and at a door or other locations. The thief must be quiet and in a quiet environment.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Upon attaining 4th level, a thief gains the ability to read languages (including ciphers, treasure maps, and dead languages, but not magical writings) with a proficiency throw of 5+ on 1d20. If the roll does not succeed, the thief may not try to read that particular piece of writing until he reaches a higher level of experience.</p>
            <p>When a thief attains 9th level (Master Thief), he can establish a hideout, and 2d6 thief apprentices of 1st level will come to work with the character. If hired, they must be paid standard rates for ruffians. A successful character might use these followers to start a Thieves’ Guild.</p>
            <p>At 10th level, a thief can read and cast magic from arcane scrolls with a proficiency throw of 3+ on 1d20. However, a failed throw means the spell does not function as expected, and can create a horrible effect at the Judge’s discretion.</p>

        <div class="sheet-value"><span><strong>Brawling</strong> - The target suffers an additional 1d4 damage from a strike from the attacker’s gauntlet, pommel, or shield rim.

        <div class="sheet-value"><span><strong>Damage Shield</strong> - The target’s shield is damaged, reducing its effectiveness by 1. If the shield is non-magical, this will destroy it. Damaged shields can be repaired at a cost of 10gp per point of effectiveness. Magic shields cannot be damaged except by magic weapons or monsters of 5 HD or more.</span></div>

        {{#rollTotal() Roll 5}}
        <div class="sheet-value"><span><strong>Force Back</strong> - The target is forced back (as the special maneuver). It must withdraw a number of feet equal to the attacker’s damage roll. If this would push the opponent into a wall or obstacle, the opponent is knocked down, and takes 1d6 points of damage per 10’ he has traveled.</span></div>

Once prone, the creature can move, but only to crawl at a movement rate of 5’, to take an action in lieu of moving, or to end the condition by using an action in lieu of moving to stand up. If engaged, the prone creature remains subject to the movement restrictions of being engaged, so it can only crawl if using defensive movement, and cannot stand up in lieu of moving. The prone creature can attack, but suffers a -4 penalty on its attack throws. Alternatively the prone creature can stand up in lieu of attacking. The prone creature can be backstabbed by creatures capable of doing so. Attack throws against the prone creatures gain a +2 bonus, or a +4 bonus if the attacker backstabs the stunned creature.

If the target’s weapon is a non-magical spear, staff, or pole arm, it shatters into splinters when sundered, dealing an additional 1d4 nonlethal damage to the target. Swords cannot be sundered by non-metal weapons or natural attacks by creatures of less than 5 HD. Magic weapons cannot be sundered except by other magic weapons or monsters of 5 HD or more.</span></div>

        <div class="sheet-value"><span><strong>Stun</strong> - The target is stunned until the end of its next initiative. A stunned creature cannot attack, cast spells, or move. It gains no benefit to its AC from its shield (if any), and can be ambushed or backstabbed by creatures capable of doing so. All attack throws against stunned creatures gain a +2 bonus, or a +4 bonus if the attacker ambushes or backstabs the stunned creature.</span></div>

        <div class="sheet-value"><span><strong>Wrestle/Clamber</strong> - The results of this critical effect depend on the difference in size between the attacker and target.
