This macro requires the GroupInitiative Roll20 API script to be installed.

To configure the script for use with the character sheet, go to the R20 Chat window and enter this command:
* !group-init --add-group Bare dex_mod Bare class_initiative_bonus Bare mod_initiative

Access !group-init --help, then set the "Initiative Die Size" property to '6'.

Make other customization as desired - see the script documentation, above, as well as:
https://wiki.roll20.net/Script:Group_Initiative

Here's the macro text that I use:
!group-init --clear
!group-init
